[{"categories":["NSM","GrowthHack"],"contents":"In general, we all understand NSM is one metric that the whole organization goes behind. However, when you try to identify such a metric, you will have a hard time. More the stakeholders you involve, more will be the number of goals they would want to achieve, and every such goal will have one or more metrics, considering each of those goals to be important, You will find it even more harded to select a NSM .\nYou can use the below tests to check if you metric can be a NSM\nCan you control this metric? Are there ways to influence a change in the metric, Do you have levers can you leverage and push the metrics up? In other words is there an action you can take and course correct?\nIs there a strong correlation with revenue? Any metric you choose as an NSM should have a strong correlation to the revenue you generate. If the metric increases in value, your revenue should also increase.\nIs it a measure of value that a customer receives from your product/service? You should have a metric which measures the value it provides, say for example you are providing a demo to a customer. Two metrics of interest would be the Number of Demos provided, and another would-be sales post demo. In this case, both metrics have a strong correlation with revenue. However having the organization go behind the number of sales post demo is a better indicator of your business health, thereby a better NSM.\nCan you track this metric on a daily/weekly basis, and does it measure progress? Ideally, you should be able to track/determine the metric in accordance with the cycle of business, it could be daily, weekly, or monthly. You should have the ability to track this regularly. Let\u0026rsquo;s take an example here, say metric is \u0026quot; the number of students clearing an exam\u0026quot;. This metric can be determined only after the results are declared. It cannot be determined regularly, also you cannot change the outcome of the result. A better NSM would be something that helps you evaluate the learnings of the student at regular intervals.\nIs it a simple and ubiquitous metric? The metric you choose should be simple, everyone in your organization should know what it is, and how it is determined. And it should mean the same to everyone, it should not take different meanings based on whom you talk to. if the metric is complex to determine, it is going to be so much harder for you to communicate, because of the complexity different teams could perceive it in different ways, which defeats the purpose of having an NSM.\nDoes the metric cover the journey of the customer ? Ideally, if you have a metric that tracks the entire journey, it is the best suited for NSM. however, you can choose a metric that covers only certain parts of the journey. This selection should be done based on your goal. If the goal is product sales, then the number of units sold will be your metric, in this case, NSM will not consider the number of units returned, this is perfectly fine, you can always track returns as a guideline metric.\nThere is no easy way to determine an NSM that works for you, it\u0026rsquo;s driven based on what is important for the organization, and it is tied very closely to the mission and vision of the organization.\n","date":"2023-04-24T16:50:28+08:00","permalink":"https://vijaypalyam.github.io/post/good-test-of-nsm/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"What is a good test of a North Start Metric?"},{"categories":["NSM","GrowthHack","ProductManagement"],"contents":"If you think you need help monitoring and measuring the success of your product. Then you are most likely struggling to create a meaningful dashboard for your Product. The sheer number of metrics that indicate the effectiveness and performance of your product, Metrics indicating the behavior and satisfaction of your customers will overwhelm you.\nYou will struggle to draw co-relations between the various metrics, you will also struggle to identify the frequency with which you need to monitor them as well. Finding a solution to this challenge is no easy job unless you have clarity on the metrics you want to monitor.\nBelow are some recommendations to help you sort the clutter and help you create a useful Dashboard to monitor your product and business.\nBegin by identifying a metric that is deeply connected with your vision. This will be the Star metric you would want to see grow over the years. This should be a long-term metric which is should never decline. This metric is often called a North Star as it will help you course correct.\nThe next step would be to identify what is called a Driver metric, such metrics help you measure the actions and behaviors that influence your North Star. you also need to identify the time scale with respect to which you would want to see this metric on the dashboard.\nLastly for each of your driver metrics identify the guard rail metrics. As the name indicates these metrics will come with a threshold you do not want to cross. These thresholds can or will change with time, but you should always have the threshold defined and indicated on the graphs.\nA good dashboard should not be crammed with all identified metrics into a single view. A good pattern will be to have a main Product dashboard that shows North Star and Driver metrics. And for every driver metrics have a secondary dashboard with its related guard rail metrics. This way you can control your focus and gain required insights in a context you are monitoring. Hope this post gives you sufficient direction to help you better manage your product.\n","date":"2023-04-19T18:58:11+08:00","permalink":"https://vijaypalyam.github.io/post/need-help-monitoring-measuring-success-product/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"Need help monitoring and measuring the success of your product?"},{"categories":["NSM","GrowthHack","ProductManagement"],"contents":"Most people define North Star metric as the single most important driver of success and it provides an initiative for the whole company to rally behind. Though this is a good definition, it does not explain what it reflects and what it leads to. North Star should reflect the customer value proposition and the long-term vision of the product. It should also lead to revenue, it should lead to measuring progress, and influence behavior of the entire organization.\nWhether a dashboard should have a north star metric depends on the purpose and scope of the dashboard. However a north star metric is usually relevant for a product dashboard, which tracks how well the product is delivering value to customers and achieving the product vision. A product dashboard can have a north star metric as the main focus, and other supporting metrics that influence or are influenced by the north star metric. A north star metric can be a powerful way to align and motivate a product team around a common goal and measure their impact on customers.\nNot having a north star metric can have several negative consequences for a product team and a company. Some of them are:\nLack of clarity and alignment: Without a clear and shared metric that reflects the customer value and the business goal, different teams and departments may have conflicting priorities, goals, and incentives. This can lead to confusion, duplication of effort, wasted resources, and missed opportunities.\nLack of accountability and impact: Without a measurable and meaningful metric that shows the progress and outcome of the product initiatives, product teams may focus on shipping features rather than solving problems. This can result in low-quality products, poor customer satisfaction, and weak retention.\nLack of direction and strategy: Without a guiding metric that indicates the long-term vision and growth potential of the product, product teams may lose sight of the big picture and chase short-term wins or vanity metrics. This can result in losing competitive advantage, innovation, and market fit. Therefore, having a north star metric is important for product teams and companies to stay focused, aligned, accountable, impactful, and strategic.\nHope these thoughts will inspire you to think about North Star metric and start conversations around this metric.\n","date":"2023-04-17T22:19:13+08:00","permalink":"https://vijaypalyam.github.io/post/what-is-nsm/","section":"post","tags":null,"title":"What is North Star metric?
